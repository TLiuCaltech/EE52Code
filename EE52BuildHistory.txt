EE52 Board Build

4/7/16
Added the 5 mounting stands

4/8/16
Added 5 test points. Checked for continuity (all good - no shorts)
C46 and C47 (1 uF)
10nF caps
10 uF caps (continuity checked)
C37 (47 nF)
C1 (47 uF)
C6 and C53 (33 pF)
C5, C10, C16
C4, C11, C17 (continuity checked)
C20, C2, C40, C19, C21 (GND - VCC continuity good)
C12, C22, C49, C29, C40

4/9/16
C3, C13, C15, C48
C36, C7, C28, C41, C42, C43 (continuity checked - no shorts)
C26, C27, C44, C34, C35, C39 (continuity checked - no short)
C30, C31, C32 (continuity checked - no shorts)
Note: all caps now done (I think)
Trimmed cap leads further down.
U8 (LM1086 voltage regulator)
J1 DC power jack
Spliced open DC power adapter - white wire is VCC
Soldered white wire VCC to the corresponding lead on male jack

4/10/16 - 8am
Added hot glue to cover bare wires in DC jack
Soldered other wire to the smaller lead
Smashed the DC power jack case back in
Tested for five volts on board - 5.02V and 3.24V recorded (looks good)

4/11/16
R76 and R77 (LED resistors) soldered. LEDs both turn on (yay!)
SW1 Reset and SW10 Trap
Sockets for U9, U10, X1, U4

4/12/16
Sockets for U7, U11, U13, U16
R20, R105
R2 (external oscillator resistor)
Tested SW1 Reset - lights up correctly
NOTE: Make sure to think about order that the CPLDs are soldered on b/c the 
sockets are larger than the footprints and there isn’t room for the
resistors on the top of the board.
R3, R4, R5, R8 (11k CPU resistors)
SW3 - SW9
Sockets U19-21

4/13/16
Inserted U2 (CPU) and X1 (external oscillator) into sockets
Inserted U4 (Reset) into socket
Soldered header P20, 21, 22, 12, 3, 4, 13, 17, 9, 8

4/15/16
R82, R83, R84, R85 (zero ohm buffer resistors)
Trace to DB0 was accidentally destroyed - will need to wire wrap
Soldered P16 or at least what could be soldered
P4 and P17
R21-R27 and R97-104
Tested switches - SW2, SW3, and SW7 aren’t lighting up - could be solder
joints are poor or broken switches

4/16/16
Repaired SW2, SW3, and SW7. Best guess is that I melted the insides while
soldering the large middle pin. Pulled out the switches and replaced
them with new ones. Did not solder the large middle pin, but they all
seem to work fine.
Tested SW10 watchdog switch with multimeter - seems to work fine
Measured voltage levels of all switches - all good :)

4/17/16
Inserted U1, U3, U5, and U9 into sockets
Header P14
Plugged serial debugger in the wrong way and chips started smoking - very
bad. Probably destroyed.
Serial debugger still works, but board not connecting. Soldered P1 header
Temporary resistor to pull SRDY up

4/18/16
R14, R11, R80

4/20/16
Inserted 74ALS245 into U11 (switch buffer)

4/22/16
Swapped U1 74ALS573 for 74AL573 to try and eliminate ground bounce and
make serial debugger more reliable - didn’t work

4/23/16
R41, R62, R35, R16, R55, R36, U17 socket
Resoldered some of the joints on U10 ROM socket and soldered a joint
that hadn’t been soldered - that joint was probably source of reliability
problems :P

4/25/16
Soldered in LCD1 sockets and R75 (backlight resistor) and R37 pot
Removed pull up resistor for SRDY and instead soldered wire wrap wire
between SRDY1 and SRDY
Inserted U17 CPLD into socket
Serial debugger still connects (phew)

5/7/16

Soldered R32, R33, R34, R38, R39, R17 (for CPLD U12)
R65 - R70, R71, R72, R73 (MUX enables) - continuity checked. Still good, but
unexpected rise in resistance
R64, R63, R15, and R7
Loaded and tested code again - all good
Socket U12 for CPLD and inserted CPLD
Loaded and tested display/button code - still works, notably slower

5/8/16
Soldered U12 DRAM socket - didn’t think about orientation but very luckily
I think I got it right.

5/9/16
Inserted U19, U20, U21 and DRAM into sockets

5/10/16
Soldered some pins on the mux sockets that weren’t soldered, which was
leading to some issues. DRAM appears to be working.
