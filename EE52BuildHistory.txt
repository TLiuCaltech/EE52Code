EE52 Board Build

4/7/16
Added the 5 mounting stands

4/8/16
Added 5 test points. Checked for continuity (all good - no shorts)
C46 and C47 (1 uF)
10nF caps
10 uF caps (continuity checked)
C37 (47 nF)
C1 (47 uF)
C6 and C53 (33 pF)
C5, C10, C16
C4, C11, C17 (continuity checked)
C20, C2, C40, C19, C21 (GND - VCC continuity good)
C12, C22, C49, C29, C40

4/9/16
C3, C13, C15, C48
C36, C7, C28, C41, C42, C43 (continuity checked - no shorts)
C26, C27, C44, C34, C35, C39 (continuity checked - no short)
C30, C31, C32 (continuity checked - no shorts)
Note: all caps now done (I think)
Trimmed cap leads further down.
U8 (LM1086 voltage regulator)
J1 DC power jack
Spliced open DC power adapter - white wire is VCC
Soldered white wire VCC to the corresponding lead on male jack

4/10/16 - 8am
Added hot glue to cover bare wires in DC jack
Soldered other wire to the smaller lead
Smashed the DC power jack case back in
Tested for five volts on board - 5.02V and 3.24V recorded (looks good)

4/11/16
R76 and R77 (LED resistors) soldered. LEDs both turn on (yay!)
SW1 Reset and SW10 Trap
Sockets for U9, U10, X1, U4

4/12/16
Sockets for U7, U11, U13, U16
R20, R105
R2 (external oscillator resistor)
Tested SW1 Reset - lights up correctly
NOTE: Make sure to think about order that the CPLDs are soldered on b/c the 
sockets are larger than the footprints and there isnâ€™t room for the
resistors on the top of the board.
R3, R4, R5, R8 (11k CPU resistors)
SW3 - SW9
Sockets U19-21

4/13/16
Inserted U2 (CPU) and X1 (external oscillator) into sockets
Inserted U4 (Reset) into socket
Soldered header P20, 21, 22, 12, 3, 4, 13, 17, 9, 8
